This repository is for a reinforcement learning bot that can learn to trade crypto on live data. It uses Deep Q Learning to make decisions that will increase it's reward after each epsiode it performs. As of right now the repository contains three files. A script that fetches live Bitcoin data that the bot can use while running, a script that initially creates and begins to train the bot for however long you want, and a script that takes the trained bot and continues to train it and produces a new refined model. 

The web scraper for the Bitcoin data creates a CSV file and writes timestamp, price, market cap, fully diluted market cap, volume, volume/market cap, ciculating supply, and max supply data. The bot uses this by reading the lowest file on the CSV so you must run the scraper script before starting the bot training. Because of this you can start and stop the scraper whenever you want to start and stop training the bot and restart it up again on the same CSV.
